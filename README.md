## The Challange

Creating my own portfolio website using Next.js and TypeScript was an exciting challenge.The goal was to design a user-friendly and visually appealing platform with dark mode that not only highlights my projects and expertise but also provides visitors with an engaging experience.

Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing responsive design, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless navigation. Incorporating TypeScript added an extra layer of type safety, enabling more robust and maintainable code.
