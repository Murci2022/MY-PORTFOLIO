## Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio website built using Next.js! This project showcases my skills, projects, and provides insights into my journey as a web developer. The website is designed to highlight my expertise, share my experiences, and connect with fellow developers and potential collaborators.

## The Challange

Creating my own portfolio website using Next.js and TypeScript was an exciting challenge that allowed me to showcase my skills and creativity in web development. The goal was to design a user-friendly and visually appealing platform that not only highlights my projects and expertise but also provides visitors with an engaging experience.

Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing responsive design, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless navigation. Incorporating TypeScript added an extra layer of type safety, enabling more robust and maintainable code.
